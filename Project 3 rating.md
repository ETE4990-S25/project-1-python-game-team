The game is overall good and intregated many features disscusses in class. However minor improvements can be made here and there in regards to error handling and readability

I cannot reasonably find any flaws in this code. If i were to nit pick maybe the use of emoji in final product is not approprate here and the gameplay loop is a little stale but thats the only thing I can find about this code. Almost damn near perfect.

Very creative and fun game. The game is very playable and has a lot of potential. There were some problems with classes and inheireting these classes but overall very good.
